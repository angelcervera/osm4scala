Because for publishing/distributing OpenStreenMap data size saving is looked, practically all OpenStreetMap datasets are
using the [PBF2 OpenStreetMap file format](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format).
This format has been designed to achieve good compression, but it is really complex to obtain an optimized way to process its content.

This library achieves two different goals:
- [Spark Connector](spark-connector.mdx): Polyglot Scala, Python, SQL and R Spark connector to query OSM Pbf files.
- [Core library](standalone-scala-library.mdx): High performance Scala library to read OSM Pbf files as Scala Iterators.
