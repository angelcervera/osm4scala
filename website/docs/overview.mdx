Because for publishing/distributing OpenStreenMap data size saving is looked, practically all OpenStreetMap datasets are
using the [PBF2 OpenStreetMap file format](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format).
This format has been designed to achieve good compression, but it is really complex to obtain an optimized way to process its content.

This library achieves two different goals:
- [Spark Connector](spark-connector.mdx): Polyglot Scala, Python, SQL and R Spark connector to query OSM Pbf files.
- [Core library](standalone-scala-library.mdx): High performance Scala library to read OSM Pbf files as Scala Iterators.

## Question and support?

I'm doing my best, but keep in mind that this is an opensource project, developed for free.

If you need / want osm4scala (or Scala, BigData, Spark, Java, etc...) premium support, don't hesitate to [contact me and contract my services](https://www.acervera.com).

For free community support, there are two channels:
- If it is a technical question: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/osm4scala) with the tag `[osm4scala]`.
  **I will response asap**. Please, try to be clear, adding simple examples to reproduce the error or whatever the problem is.
- If it is suggestion, generic question or anything that does not fit in the Stackoverflow scope, the best options is
  [![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/osm4scala/talk.svg)](https://gitter.im/osm4scala/talk). A message to my
  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelcervera/) account is a good option as well.
