First of all, if you arrived to this point, thanks for at least think about contributing!!!

## Ways to contribute
- Spread the word. Maybe a project in Github with a post in your blog, with a link to [osm4scala repo](https://github.com/simplexspatial/osm4scala)
- Join [![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/osm4scala/talk.svg)](https://gitter.im/osm4scala/talk) group
- Response questions in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stackoverflow will send you notifications if you are
  watching the [osm4scala](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/osm4scala) tag.
- Post or comment issues for bugs, new features, feedback, etc.
- Contributing with improvements or fixes using a Pull Request.

## Pull requests checkpoints:
Before spending your expensive time on coding and creating PRs, please:
- Discuss with the authors on an issue ticket prior to doing anything big.
- I appreciate all contributions, and I understand that usually people do it for free, **like me**. But please,
  I don't want to spend all my free time doing code reviews. So keep this in mind and don't modify anything that
  is not necessary. On this way, I can keep focus in the change core, and review and ship asap. Example: If you modify
  one line of code, don't reformat the full file!!
- Follow the style, naming and structure conventions of the rest of the project.
- There is a `scalastyle` and a `scalafmt` config file in root of the repository. Use it.
- Follow the official [Scala Style Guide](https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/)
- Using Scala inference and the compiler optimization coming from there is good. So use it and specify typing only
  for public functions/properties to help the API user. If the developer cannot figure out the type in a short
  function (or short scope), then there is a problem with the code complexity, with the developer or with both.
- Variable names should be self descriptive and camel case. `_` or others not alphabetical chars are not allowed
  if there is not a real reason.
- If you find that repeating a function/property name is needed, something is wrong. It means that two function/property
  are used for the same thing, so you can remove one of them. Never try to fix it adding a prefix (like `_` or `$`)
- One feature per PR. Don't modify things that are not related to the ticket and are not necessary for it.
- If you find something wrong or that could be better, create a new ticket and fix it there (even if it is simple formatting style)
- Make your commits atomics and easy to merge and review. Keep in mind that only "squash and rebase" is available in the PR.
- Always apply KISS principle
- No code duplication allowed at all. That is the first symptom of horrible design.
- Try always functional approaches over imperative. Sometime is not possible, specially working with iterators over files
  (it means mutability and side effects) like in this project, but all around that should be as functional as possible.
- Don't pollute the code with things that does not add **value**.
- Avoid using other libraries as possible. This is a library used with other complex frameworks like Spark or toolkits
  like AKKA. Dependencies in these cases are source of problems.
- Again, modify only the code that is strictly necessary and it's inside of the scope of the ticket. Currently, all stuff
  work with no problem and with a great performance, so it is ok (In fact, this is the point!).
- If you think something could be better, great! Create a ticket with a good description (why, motivation, etc) and
  we can talk from there.
- Don't write production code for testing or debugging. All related with testing should be with the testing source code.
- Verify that all tests are passing, for all Scala/Spark version available, even if you think that you did not touch anything.
  ```
  PATCH_211=false sbt clean +test
  PATCH_211=true sbt clean +test
  ```
- I hope this long list did not scare you. ðŸ™‡
